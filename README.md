# AR Room Styler

## Overview
AR Room Styler is an augmented reality (AR) application that allows users to interact with 3D models in real-time. Users can place, move, and rotate virtual furniture in their real environment using ARCore technology.

## Features
- **Real-time 3D Model Placement:** Select and place 3D models into the real world through the camera.
- **Plane Detection:** Automatically detects flat surfaces like floors and tables to position furniture.
- **Object Movement:** Move objects across detected surfaces using ARCore.
- **Model Rotation:** Rotate models to view them from different angles.
- **Light Estimation:** Adjusts brightness and shadows dynamically based on real-world lighting conditions.
- **Depth API:** Enhances realism by utilizing depth perception for accurate object placement.
- **Gesture Handling:** Users can interact with objects using touch gestures (tap, drag, rotate).

## Tech Stack
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces.
- **ARCore** - Google's platform for building augmented reality experiences.
- **Kotlin** - Primary language for Android development.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PhuGHs/AR_RoomStyler.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an ARCore-supported device.

## Usage
- Open the app and grant necessary permissions.
- Scan the environment to detect surfaces.
- Select a 3D model and place it in the scene.
- Use gestures to move and rotate the model.
- Enjoy your AR experience!
